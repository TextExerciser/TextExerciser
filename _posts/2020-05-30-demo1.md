## Demo
Here are some demos which show how TE generates text input based on hints on UI. 
### Mutate text input based on hints
This demo shows how TE adaptively changes the text input of *'username'* in *Cram* app based on the hints. TE first generates an input *'a'* for it which doesn't satisfy the length constraint, i.e. *'Your username must be at least four characters'*. Then, TE generates a new input, i.e. *'a.G=Z'*, based on the hint. However, it still illformats which leads to a new hint, i.e. *'Username must contain only letter, numbers or dashes'*, shown on screen. Finally, TE changes input to *‘7bGaZ4’*, a valid text for this app, and passes this UI page successfully.
