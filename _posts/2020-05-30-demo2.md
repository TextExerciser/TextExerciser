### Extract verification code
Here is a demo that TE extracts verify code from SMS. In the registration of *Yandex* apk, TE first generates text inputs for name, password, and phone number. Note that, for the convenience of receiving verification code from app server, TE supports to specify the phone number as a real one based on the configuration in *config.json* file. Then the *'smsOberserver'* app running in the physical phone will read the SMS inbox and forward the message to TE. Then, TE will inject the verification code to the corresponding text box and finish the account registration.
