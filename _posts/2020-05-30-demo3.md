### Handle the coress-view hint
As hint and its corresponding text box are not always shown on the same UI page, this demo gives an example of how TE traces UI back to the target view which contains the related text box, then changes the text input based on the hint in corss view. Specifically, in *Meet24* app, email address is sent into Page1. After filling out the information in Page2, a hint, *'This e-mail address is already use in Meet24'*, blocks the execution. Then TE navigates UI back to the Page1, and generates a new email to advance the execution.
