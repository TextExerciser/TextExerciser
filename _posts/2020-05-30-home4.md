In the case of another hint, TextExerciser will iterate the above procedure until TextExerciser ﬁnds a valid input.
### Tool Implementation 
We implement it in python code based on [Uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2) to interacte with tested app in phone/emulator, such as fetching dynamic layout information on current UI, exploring the widgets on screen, etc. And a [CNN-RNN Neural Network](https://github.com/jiegzhan/multi-class-text-classification-cnn-rnn) Model is applied to identify and classify hints. We use [Standford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.html) tools to parse hint texts in *HP* module and [Z3StrSolver](https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/) to solve the input constraints in *IG* module.<br>
This is the working flow of TextExerciser. The *Physical Phone* on the left is used for running the *smsOberserver* app which transmits the varify code SMS to *PC*. In the middle, the *PC* executes the main function of TextExerciser in Python.
