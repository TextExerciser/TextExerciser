### TextExerciser WorkFlow
TextExerciser provides a novel approach to automatically generate valid text inputs in testing Android apps. The key insight here is that if a text input does not satisfy the enforced constraints, the Android app will provide clues or hints for the malformed input, which can be used as a feedback for improvement. The workflow of our methodology is as follow :

* Hint Extractor(*HE*) : The main function of *HE* is to extract hints shown on UI. It first extracts all the texts in the app’s UI and then identiﬁes static hints via a learning based method and dynamic hints via a structure-based differential analysis. 
* Hint Parser(*HP*) : *HP* is mainly used for parsing and extracting key elements(i.e. constraints) from hints. It parses all the extracted hints via three steps: classifying hints into different categories, generating syntax trees for each hint, and interpreting the generated tree into a constraint representation form.
* Input Generation Engine(*IG*) : In this module, *IG* generates text input based on constraints. Specifically, it first maps constraints into the solver, and then generates a concrete input by solving the problem based on hints.
